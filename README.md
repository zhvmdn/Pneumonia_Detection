### Pneumonia_Detection

## Introduction:
# Problem:
Pneumonia is one of the very contagious diseases, the so-called "Lung Infection" that has affected the lives of millions of people around the world. You're more likely to get pneumonia if you have asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or heart disease. Most often, this disease causes respiratory symptoms that can be very similar to shortness of breath, acute respiratory viral infections or tachycardia. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. Pneumonia can be quickly and accurately diagnosed using computed tomography (CT) and chest X-ray (CXR). However, since it takes a long time and is very prone to human error, identifying an infection manually using a radio image is quite difficult. Our goal is to create an image recognition model that will allow us to determine the presence of Pneumonia from an X-ray image of the patient's lungs.
